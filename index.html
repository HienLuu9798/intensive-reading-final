            <h3>The Dead Sea Scrolls</h3>
                <p id="text-content">
                In late 1946 or early 1947, three Bedouin teenagers were tending their goats and sheep
                near the ancient settlement of Qumran, located on the northwest shore of the Dead
                Sea in what is now known as the West Bank. One of these young shepherds tossed a
                rock into an opening on the side of a cliff and was surprised to hear a shattering sound.
                He and his companions later entered the cave and stumbled across a collection of
                large clay jars, seven of which contained scrolls with writing on them. The teenagers
                took the seven scrolls to a nearby town where they were sold for a small sum to a local
                antiquities dealer. Word of the find spread, and Bedouins and archaeologists eventually
                unearthed tens of thousands of additional scroll fragments from 10 nearby caves;
                together they make up between 800 and 900 manuscripts. It soon became clear that this
                was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries ever made.</p>
                <p id="text-content">
                The origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written around 2,000 years ago between
                150 BCE and 70 CE, is still the subject of scholarly debate even today. According to the
                prevailing theory, they are the work of a population that inhabited the area until Roman
                troops destroyed the settlement around 70 CE. The area was known as Judea at that
                time, and the people are thought to have belonged to a group called the Essenes, a
                devout Jewish sect.</p>
                <p id="text-content">The majority of the texts on the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Hebrew, with some fragments
                written in an ancient version of its alphabet thought to have fallen out of use in the fifth
                century BCE. But there are other languages as well. Some scrolls are in Aramaic, the
                language spoken by many inhabitants of the region from the sixth century BCE to the
                siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In addition, several texts feature translations of the Hebrew
                Bible into Greek.</p>
                <p id="text-content">
                The Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments from every book of the Old Testament of the
                Bible except for the Book of Esther. The only entire book of the Hebrew Bible preserved
                among the manuscripts from Qumran is Isaiah; this copy, dated to the first century BCE,
                is considered the earliest biblical manuscript still in existence. Along with biblical texts,
                the scrolls include documents about sectarian regulations and religious writings that do
                not appear in the Old Testament.</p>
                <p id="text-content">
                The writing on the Dead Sea Scrolls is mostly in black or occasionally red ink, and
                the scrolls themselves are nearly all made of either parchment (animal skin) or an
                early form of paper called ‘papyrus’. The only exception is the scroll numbered 3Q15,
                which was created out of a combination of copper and tin. Known as the Copper
                Scroll, this curious document features letters chiselled onto metal – perhaps, as some
                have theorized, to better withstand the passage of time. One of the most intriguing
                manuscripts from Qumran, this is a sort of ancient treasure map that lists dozens of gold
                and silver caches. Using an unconventional vocabulary and odd spelling, it describes 64
                underground hiding places that supposedly contain riches buried for safekeeping. None
                of these hoards have been recovered, possibly because the Romans pillaged Judea
                during the first century CE. According to various hypotheses, the treasure belonged to
                local people, or was rescued from the Second Temple before its destruction or never
                existed to begin with.</p>
                <p id="text-content">
                Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been on interesting journeys. In 1948, a Syrian
                Orthodox archbishop known as Mar Samuel acquired four of the original seven scrolls
                from a Jerusalem shoemaker and part-time antiquity dealer, paying less than $100
                for them. He then travelled to the United States and unsuccessfully offered them to a
                number of universities, including Yale. Finally, in 1954, he placed an advertisement in
                the business newspaper The Wall Street Journal – under the category ‘Miscellaneous
                Items for Sale’ – that read: ‘Biblical Manuscripts dating back to at least 200 B.C. are for
                sale. This would be an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution by an individual
                or group.’ Fortunately, Israeli archaeologist and statesman Yigael Yadin negotiated their
                purchase and brought the scrolls back to Jerusalem, where they remain to this day.</p></p>
                In 2017, researchers from the University of Haifa restored and deciphered one of the last
                untranslated scrolls. The university’s Eshbal Ratson and Jonathan Ben-Dov spent one
                year reassembling the 60 fragments that make up the scroll. Deciphered from a band
                of coded text on parchment, the find provides insight into the community of people who
                wrote it and the 364-day calendar they would have used. The scroll names celebrations
                that indicate shifts in seasons and details two yearly religious events known from
                another Dead Sea Scroll. Only one more known scroll remains untranslated.</p>

            <h3>A second attempt at domesticating the tomato</h3>
            <h3>A</h3> <p id="text-content">It took at least 3,000 years for humans to learn how to domesticate the wild tomato
                and cultivate it for food. Now two separate teams in Brazil and China have done it all
                over again in less than three years. And they have done it better in some ways, as
                the re-domesticated tomatoes are more nutritious than the ones we eat at present.
                This approach relies on the revolutionary CRISPR genome editing technique, in
                which changes are deliberately made to the DNA of a living cell, allowing genetic
                material to be added, removed or altered. The technique could not only improve
                existing crops, but could also be used to turn thousands of wild plants into useful
                and appealing foods. In fact, a third team in the US has already begun to do this
                with a relative of the tomato called the groundcherry.
                This fast-track domestication could help make the world’s food supply healthier and
                far more resistant to diseases, such as the rust fungus devastating wheat crops.
                ‘This could transform what we eat,’ says Jorg Kudla at the University of Munster in
                Germany, a member of the Brazilian team. ‘There are 50,000 edible plants in the
                world, but 90 percent of our energy comes from just 15 crops.’
                ‘We can now mimic the known domestication course of major crops like rice, maize,
                sorghum or others,’ says Caixia Gao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
                ‘Then we might try to domesticate plants that have never been domesticated.’</p>
            <h3>B</h3> <p id="text-content">Wild tomatoes, which are native to the Andes region in South America, produce
                pea-sized fruits. Over many generations, peoples such as the Aztecs and Incas
                transformed the plant by selecting and breeding plants with mutations* in their
                genetic structure, which resulted in desirable traits such as larger fruit.
                But every time a single plant with a mutation is taken from a larger population for
                breeding, much genetic diversity is lost. And sometimes the desirable mutations
                come with less desirable traits. For instance, the tomato strains grown for
                supermarkets have lost much of their flavour.
                By comparing the genomes of modern plants to those of their wild relatives,
                biologists have been working out what genetic changes occurred as plants were
                domesticated. The teams in Brazil and China have now used this knowledge to
                reintroduce these changes from scratch while maintaining or even enhancing the
                desirable traits of wild strains.</p>
            <h3>C</h3> <p id="text-content">Kudla’s team made six changes altogether. For instance, they tripled the size
                of fruit by editing a gene called FRUIT WEIGHT, and increased the number of
                tomatoes per truss by editing another called MULTIFLORA.
                While the historical domestication of tomatoes reduced levels of the red pigment
                lycopene – thought to have potential health benefits – the team in Brazil managed
                to boost it instead. The wild tomato has twice as much lycopene as cultivated ones;
                the newly domesticated one has five times as much.
                ‘They are quite tasty,’ says Kudla. ‘A little bit strong. And very aromatic.’
                The team in China re-domesticated several strains of wild tomatoes with desirable
                traits lost in domesticated tomatoes. In this way they managed to create a strain
                resistant to a common disease called bacterial spot race, which can devastate
                yields. They also created another strain that is more salt tolerant – and has higher
                levels of vitamin C.</p>
            <h3>D</h3> <p id="text-content">Meanwhile, Joyce Van Eck at the Boyce Thompson Institute in New York state
                decided to use the same approach to domesticate the groundcherry or goldenberry
                (Physalis pruinosa) for the first time. This fruit looks similar to the closely related
                Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana).
                Groundcherries are already sold to a limited extent in the US but they are hard to
                produce because the plant has a sprawling growth habit and the small fruits fall
                off the branches when ripe. Van Eck’s team has edited the plants to increase fruit
                size, make their growth more compact and to stop fruits dropping. ‘There’s potential
                for this to be a commercial crop,’ says Van Eck. But she adds that taking the
                work further would be expensive because of the need to pay for a licence for the
                CRISPR technology and get regulatory approval.</p>
            <h3>E</h3> <p id="text-content">This approach could boost the use of many obscure plants, says Jonathan Jones
                of the Sainsbury Lab in the UK. But it will be hard for new foods to grow so popular
                with farmers and consumers that they become new staple crops, he thinks.
                The three teams already have their eye on other plants that could be ‘catapulted
                into the mainstream’, including foxtail, oat-grass and cowpea. By choosing wild
                plants that are drought or heat tolerant, says Gao, we could create crops that will
                thrive even as the planet warms.
                But Kudla didn’t want to reveal which species were in his team’s sights, because
                CRISPR has made the process so easy. ‘Any one with the right skills could go to
                their lab and do this.’</p>

            </p>YYou should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 27–40</strong>, which are based on Reading
            Passage 3 below.</p>
            <h3>Insight or evolution?</h3>
            <i id="text-content">Two scientists consider the origins of discoveries and other innovative behavior</i> 
                <p id="text-content">Scientific discovery is popularly believed to result from the sheer genius of such intellectual
                    stars as naturalist Charles Darwin and theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Our view of such
                    unique contributions to science often disregards the person’s prior experience and the efforts of
                    their lesser-known predecessors. Conventional wisdom also places great weight on insight in
                    promoting breakthrough scientific achievements, as if ideas spontaneously pop into someone’s
                    head – fully formed and functional.</p>
                <p id="text-content">There may be some limited truth to this view. However, we believe that it largely misrepresents
                    the real nature of scientific discovery, as well as that of creativity and innovation in many other
                    realms of human endeavor.</p>
                <p id="text-content">Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein – whose monumental contributions are duly
                    celebrated – we suggest that innovation is more a process of trial and error, where two steps
                    forward may sometimes come with one step back, as well as one or more steps to the right or
                    left. This evolutionary view of human innovation undermines the notion of creative genius and
                    recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific progress.</p>
                <p id="text-content">Consider one unheralded scientist: John Nicholson, a mathematical physicist working in the
                    1910s who postulated the existence of ‘proto-elements’ in outer space. By combining different
                    numbers of weights of these proto-elements’ atoms, Nicholson could recover the weights of all
                    the elements in the then-known periodic table. These successes are all the more noteworthy given
                    the fact that Nicholson was wrong about the presence of proto-elements: they do not actually
                    exist. Yet, amid his often fanciful theories and wild speculations, Nicholson also proposed a novel
                    theory about the structure of atoms. Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning father of modern atomic
                    theory, jumped off from this interesting idea to conceive his now-famous model of the atom.</p>
                <p id="text-content">What are we to make of this story? One might simply conclude that science is a collective and
                    cumulative enterprise. That may be true, but there may be a deeper insight to be gleaned. We
                    propose that science is constantly evolving, much as species of animals do. In biological systems,
                    organisms may display new characteristics that result from random genetic mutations. In the same
                    way, random, arbitrary or accidental mutations of ideas may help pave the way for advances in
                    science. If mutations prove beneficial, then the animal or the scientific theory will continue to
                    thrive and perhaps reproduce.</p>
                <p id="text-content">Support for this evolutionary view of behavioral innovation comes from many domains. Consider
                    one example of an influential innovation in US horseracing. The so-called ‘acey-deucy’ stirrup
                    placement, in which the rider’s foot in his left stirrup is placed as much as 25 centimeters lower
                    than the right, is believed to confer important speed advantages when turning on oval tracks. It
                    was developed by a relatively unknown jockey named Jackie Westrope. Had Westrope conducted
                    methodical investigations or examined extensive film records in a shrewd plan to outrun his
                    rivals? Had he foreseen the speed advantage that would be conferred by riding acey-deucy? No.
                    He suffered a leg injury, which left him unable to fully bend his left knee. His modification just
                    happened to coincide with enhanced left-hand turning performance. This led to the rapid and
                    widespread adoption of riding acey-deucy by many riders, a racing style which continues in
                    today’s thoroughbred racing.</p>
                <p id="text-content">Plenty of other stories show that fresh advances can arise from error, misadventure, and also
                        pure serendipity – a happy accident. For example, in the early 1970s, two employees of the
                        company 3M each had a problem: Spencer Silver had a product – a glue which was only slightly
                        sticky – and no use for it, while his colleague Art Fry was trying to figure out how to affix
                        temporary bookmarks in his hymn book without damaging its pages. The solution to both these
                        problems was the invention of the brilliantly simple yet phenomenally successful Post-It note.
                        Such examples give lie to the claim that ingenious, designing minds are responsible for human
                        creativity and invention. Far more banal and mechanical forces may be at work; forces that are
                        fundamentally connected to the laws of science.</p>
                <p id="text-content">The notions of insight, creativity and genius are often invoked, but they remain vague and of
                    doubtful scientific utility, especially when one considers the diverse and enduring contributions of
                    individuals such as Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Galileo, Newton, Kepler,
                    Curie, Pasteur and Edison. These notions merely label rather than explain the evolution of human
                    innovations. We need another approach, and there is a promising candidate.</p>
                <p id="text-content">The Law of Effect was advanced by psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1898, some 40 years
                    after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work on biological evolution, On the Origin
                    of Species. This simple law holds that organisms tend to repeat successful behaviors and to
                    refrain from performing unsuccessful ones. Just like Darwin’s Law of Natural Selection, the Law
                    of Effect involves an entirely mechanical process of variation and selection, without any end
                    objective in sight.</p>
